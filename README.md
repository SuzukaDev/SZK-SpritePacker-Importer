# SZK SpritePacker Importer
SZK SpritePacker Importer is a Godot addon that converts a spritesheet and JSON exported by SZK SpritePacker into a ready-to-use Godot scene.

The generated scene reproduces the original Krita (.kra) document’s hierarchy and positioning, allowing artists and developers to move from Krita to Godot without manually rebuilding scenes. Each sprite is placed and structured to match the source document, preserving layout and organization.
